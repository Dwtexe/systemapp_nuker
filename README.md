# System App Nuker  
### Take Back Control ‚Äì Because Your Device Should Work for You, Not the Other Way Around

## üí° Acknowledgements  

This module was built on top of hard work from some very cool people.

- **[@backslashxx](https://github.com/backslashxx)**  
Massive shoutout for more than just the standalone mounting scripts and whiteout logic from [`mountify`](https://github.com/backslashxx/mountify).  
A big chunk of the backend shell scripts in this module were either inspired by or directly adapted from his work.

- **[@KOWX712](https://github.com/KOWX712)**  
WebUI wizard. He made the frontend actually usable.  
Without this, you'd be staring at broken modals wondering why life suck.

- **[@KOWX712](https://github.com/KOWX712)** *(again!)*  
Also the author of [`Tricky-Addon-Update-Target-List`](https://github.com/KOWX712/Tricky-Addon-Update-Target-List), which inspired parts of the module's approach to package handling and list manipulation.

- **[@j-hc](https://github.com/j-hc)**  
Their work on [`zygisk-detach`](https://github.com/j-hc/zygisk-detach) helped shape how the module handles app list.

- **All other contributors**  
From code tweaks to bug reports to random late-night suggestions: thank you.  
You helped shape this into something that doesn‚Äôt suck to use.

Appreciate all of you. You made the thing not suck.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer  
This module is incredibly powerful! Use it wisely. Disabling critical system apps can break functionality, trigger boot loops, and make you question all your life decisions. Proceed with caution.
